# ‚úÖ Analyze news for trading signal, sentiment, confidence, and affected stocks
def analyze_article(article_text: str) -> dict:
    prompt = f"""
You are a world-class financial analyst and algorithmic trader, working at the highest level of Wall Street.
You specialize in turning breaking news into actionable market intelligence. You must evaluate the following **original news article** using institutional-grade logic.

Your task is to analyze the news like a top hedge fund would:
- Identify its potential **impact on stock prices**
- Understand **market sentiment**
- Predict **investor behavior** and positioning
- Infer **which stocks could be directly or indirectly affected**

You must deeply consider:
- Macroeconomic & microeconomic context
- Sector-specific exposure and trends
- Named companies, competitors, or suppliers
- Regulatory, geopolitical, or monetary policy implications
- Surprise factor vs expectations or earnings forecasts
- Relevance to dominant narratives (e.g. inflation, AI, rate cuts, geopolitics)
- Whether institutional and retail sentiment would diverge
- Whether the event is likely already priced in
- Momentum continuation or reversal potential

Return a pure JSON object with the following fields:
- "signal": "buy" | "sell" | "hold" | "none"
- "sentiment": "positive" | "negative" | "neutral"
- "sentimentScore": integer from 0 (very negative) to 100 (very positive)
- "confidence": integer from 0 to 100 indicating how confident the model is in the trading signal
- "relatedStocks": array of tickers

Respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include commentary, markdown, or prose.
